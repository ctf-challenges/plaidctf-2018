It's showtime. The LEDs in the picture are from a Particle Photon that the idIoT has running this program. We managed to convince him to give us a dump of the flash (idiot-1, idiot-3), but I think he figured out we were up to something: there are a suspicious number of null bytes in a couple places. However, I know he keeps one of his flags on a dashboard that he serves directly from his local filesystem, so this is definitely a worthy target. 

To help you along, I've also compiled a few helpful notes.

(You will probably need to solve both idIoT: Action and idIoT: Camera first.) 

Update: You may omit the word “LED” from the phrases used to control the lights.
